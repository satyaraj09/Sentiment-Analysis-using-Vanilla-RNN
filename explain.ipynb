    "## 1. Why ANN (Feedforward Neural Network) is not enough\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANNs assume inputs are independent.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- They process data **all at once**\n",
    "- No memory of past inputs\n",
    "- Order of data does **not** matter\n",
    "\n",
    "🔴 **Problem:**\n",
    "If you change the order of inputs (like words in a sentence), an ANN treats it the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- “I am happy”\n",
    "- “Happy am I”\n",
    "\n",
    "An ANN sees them as nearly identical → **loses meaning**\n",

    "## 2. Why CNN is not enough\n",
    "\n",
    "**CNNs are great for spatial patterns, not temporal ones.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Designed for images (height × width)\n",
    "- Local pattern detection using filters\n",
    "- Limited memory (fixed window size)\n",
    "\n",
    "🔴 **Problem:**\n",
    "CNNs do not remember **long-term dependencies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "In a sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “I grew up in France… I speak fluent \\_\\_\\_”\n",

    "CNN struggles to connect “France” with “French” when they are far apart.\n",

    "## 3. Why we need RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "**RNNs are designed for sequential data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ They have **memory**\n",
    "✔ Output depends on **previous inputs**\n",
    "✔ Order of data **matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "RNN processes data **step-by-step**, passing information forward.\n",

    "**Mathematically:**\n",

    "- (x_t) = current input\n",
    "- (h\\_{t-1}) = previous memory\n",
